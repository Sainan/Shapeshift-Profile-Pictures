Change the shape of avatars to circle, rounded, square, or anything in between. You decide.

- [For my browser](browser)
- [For Better Discord](better-discord)

Both editions can easily be edited to your preference:

```CSS
:root {
    --avatar-shape: 4px;
                  /***************\
                  * 50% : circle  *
                  * 4px : rounded *
                  * 0   : square  *
                  \***************/
}
```
