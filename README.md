# Shapeshift Profile Pictures

Change the shape of avatars to circle, rounded, square, or anything in between. You decide.

- [For my browser](browser)
- [For Better Discord](better-discord)

Both editions can easily be edited to your preference:

```CSS
:root {
    --avatar-shape: 8%;
                 /***************\
                 * 50% : circle  *
                 *  8% : rounded *
                 *   0 : square  *
                 \***************/
}
```
