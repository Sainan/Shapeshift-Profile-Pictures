If you're using [RadialStatus](https://betterdiscordlibrary.com/themes/RadialStatus) (or a theme that includes RadialStatus within it), you might want to adjust the `--rs-avatar-shape` variable in the relevant css file.

Note that there also is [BorderShapes](https://betterdiscordlibrary.com/themes/BorderShapes), which is more extensive for the specific purposes of editing borders all over Discord.
